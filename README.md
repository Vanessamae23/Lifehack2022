## Inspiration
Ever noticed your fridge is full of expired food that you will never finish? Are you constantly ordering too much food and leaving behind leftovers? Well do I have the app for you! No Waste is an app to help you reduce food waste just by taking a photo of it!

## What it does
Reducing food is as simple as PASSing it through the app!

1. Point at the Food & Take a Photo
2. Analyse the food, whether it is rotten, what type it is, when is it best consumed by.
3. Save any food you are going to keep, and keep track of its expiry date.
4. Share leftovers with others easily

No more digging for information on when something expires! No more forgetting something exists and letting it go to waste!

## How we built it
We built the app using React Native and we used Firebase for the real-time database to keep user's data and authentication
Our App has AI-based Image recognition based using Tensorflow which we trained using models of rotten food and fresh food pictures
Challenges we ran into
Limited time so it wasn't easy and challenging to develop a user-friendly interface and experience since it is only 24 hours.
Our limited expertise also made it quite difficult to be able to implement software that makes use of advanced technology and deep learning with full functionality
We also had a lack of time so we were not able to implement the necessary features to ensure a smooth sailing experience for the users and to make the app more versatile
We also did not manage to fully train our AI model to make it more accurate and we did not really have the time to test our image recognition feature using a lot of samples
Accomplishments that we're proud of
What we learned
Despite the lack of time and expertise, we learnt that programming is something that cannot really be done solo and we should support one another albeit with a tight schedule. It might seem impossible to be done at first but as Terence, one of our members said, together we can.. of course with a cup of kopi C.

We also learnt that brainstorming is a very important aspect of generating ideas and analysing whether they will be feasible for society. We also learnt how to use Github to collaborate with each other. Despite facing several difficulties, we managed to resolve conflicts in Github

## What's next for Zero Waste
Get ready for more features like

1. Analyse the amount of food wasted by taking a photo. The App can then provide better suggestions on when to reduce food before you even bought it!
2. Share the feedback with restaurant owners for them to make more informed decisions on how to reduce food waste
